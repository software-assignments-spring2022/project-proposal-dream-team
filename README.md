# Project Proposal

## Project Title: FitNet

## What and Why?

In our generation, health and fitness are becoming increasingly significant aspects of a majority of individual’s lifestyles. Unfortunately, a vast number of individuals who engage in fitness find themselves unable to effectively track and engage with the activities they’re doing, in addition to sharing their progress and achievements with their friends and family. In fact, there is a stigma associated with individuals who overuse traditional social media (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) as an outlet for their fitness/health progress, especially if they don’t fit the stereotype of a ‘fitfluencer’. Furthermore, software developed in-house by fitness companies (SoulCycle, Orange Theory, etc.) greatly limits the social aspect of sharing workouts by concentrating one’s social circle to only other members of their respective gyms. FitNet will be designed as a solution to these problems, bridging the gap between fitness and social media. Users will be able to navigate a safe space consisting of only the friends and family they select while simultaneously viewing and encouraging the progress of others.

## For whom?

FitNet will be a fitness tracker application that is viable for anyone to use, ranging from the average runner to fitness enthusiasts who seek an intense workout at the gym. As users continue to use the application and input new workouts, they will receive progress updates in their pursuit towards a healthier lifestyle. FitNet will be able to be implemented in any setting or lift stage. The user interface and software will be designed intuitively, such that its features will be easy to navigate for anyone, regardless of tech literacy or familiarity with exercise programs. Target users could be middle-aged parents looking to improve their health for comfort reasons, young people getting into fitness as a hobby, or office workers in their mid-thirties trying to introduce some extra movement into their lives. For these reasons, this application/software will be classified as a tool for mass consumption.

## How?

The end-user will have 3 basic functionalities available: A custom personal profile, input/editing of individual workouts and set/playlist of workouts, and a social feed to share workout results with friends. The app gives the user the ability to create personalized workouts in which the user can add its description, name, duration, repetitions per set, amount of set, and average calories burned. Together with this feature, the user can combine workouts into a set/playlist of workouts. As for the social aspect of the app, users will be able to follow/unfollow other users and their social feed will be populated with recent users' activity, such as new workouts created, or new workouts recently finished.

## Scope

This project is unique in the scalability and flexibility of features. We have a fundamental set of practical, social, and convenience features to implement, such as the obvious tracking functionality and a basic level of social interactivity. However, once we are satisfied with the strength of our product, we can move on to creating a much more elaborate experience. We can implement more and more convenient and customizable ways to log work, and more interactivity with friends, as well as potential integration with other services, such as Spotify playlist integration. There is no lack of potential features, and once we achieve initial functionality we can move on to expanding the service to fit the additional needs of our users.
